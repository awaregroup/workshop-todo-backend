## Backend high level steps

1. Create new Spring application - call it: ```airnz-todo-backend```.
2. Create a ```model``` package with a class called Todo. Generate the class with the following properties:
```
* Id (string)
* Title (string)
* Description (string)
* Completed (boolean)
```

3. Create a ```service``` package with an interface called ITodoService:

```java
public interface ITodoService {
    List<Todo> getAllTodos();
    Todo getTodoById(String id);
    Todo createTodo(Todo todo);
    Todo updateTodo(String id, Todo todo);
    void deleteTodo(String id);
    void deleteTodoById(String id);
}
```

4. Create an implementation of ```ITodoService``` called ```MemoryTodoService```. Let all the implementation code be autogenerated. Make sure that the class is annotated with ```@Service``` for dependency injection.

5. Create a REST controller using the route ```/api/todos``` and have it implement all the methods of ```ITodoService``` as CRUD operations. Make sure the constructor has been annotated with ```@Autowired``` so that the ```MemoryTodoService``` will be injected into the controller.

6. Make sure there's a CORS policy allowing ```*``` on the REST controller.

### Extra for experts

1. Implement testing framework of choice. Include tests (and implementation updates) for the following:

* Modify behaviour if required so the ```MemoryTodoService``` controls setting a new ID for each item. Do not allow upstream components to set the ID of the item being created.
* Make sure on modification of Todo items, the ID cannot be changed.
* Any other tests you find relevant.

2. Implement a health endpoint for the application to make sure the application is up and running.

3. Add default handler to 404. The only activate handlers should be implemented on the API routes as this project is a REST API microservice only.

4. Add timestamps and deleted flag to the Todo items.
